        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          I am an embedded software engineer and technical project manager with over 10 years of industry experience at
          <a href="https://www.lg.com" target="_blank">LG Electronics</a>, where I worked on large-scale Smart TV platforms,
          global OTT integrations, and data-driven service operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career began in biological research, where I developed Java-based 3D reconstruction tools for cellular
          imaging using TEM and HVEM. This early exposure to computational modeling later became the foundation for my
          transition into software engineering and embedded systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          At LG Electronics, I contributed as a software engineer on Smart TV recording systems and later served as a
          technical project manager, leading cross-functional initiatives across engineering, data analytics, privacy
          compliance (GDPR/CCPA), and global service operations spanning more than 50 countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently expanding my formal computer science training through graduate-level coursework, including
          <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/" target="_blank">Harvard CS50x</a>,
          <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs224w-machine-learning-graphs" target="_blank">
            Stanford’s Machine Learning with Graphs (XCS224W)
          </a>,
          and UC San Diego Extension courses in Java and Statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical interests sit at the intersection of software systems, data, and applied machine learning,
          with a practical focus on building scalable, privacy-aware platforms rather than academic research.
        </p>

        <h2>What I’m Working On</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developing a personal health and nutrition platform
            (<a href="https://github.com/deokhwajeong/BioAI-Nutrition" target="_blank">BioAI Nutrition</a>)
            using FastAPI, Next.js, and ML pipelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building graph-based data models for household health insights
            (<a href="https://github.com/deokhwajeong/family-health-graph-engine" target="_blank">Family Health Graph Engine</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthening CS fundamentals in systems, data structures, and applied ML to support long-term product
            and platform leadership roles.
          </li>
