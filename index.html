      <h2>About me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am a software engineer and technical project manager with over 10 years of
          experience building and operating large-scale Smart TV platforms at LG Electronics.
        </li>
        <li>
          My work has focused on platform execution, global OTT service operations,
          and translating product, policy, and regional requirements into stable system behavior
          across more than 50 countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have worked closely with cross-functional teams spanning engineering,
          product, legal, and operations, particularly in areas involving analytics,
          data usage, and privacy compliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am preparing to begin the Master of Science in Software Management (MSSM)
          program at Carnegie Mellon University, with the goal of strengthening my
          foundation in software systems, product decision-making, and technical leadership.
        </li>
        <li>
          My current interests center on platform-oriented roles that sit at the
          intersection of engineering execution, data-informed decision making,
          and responsible system design.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I’ve worked on</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Smart TV Platform Operations (LG Electronics)</strong><br/>
          Supported and led the operation of Smart TV services across 50+ countries,
          coordinating feature rollouts, issue resolution, and integrations with
          major OTT partners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data & Privacy-Aware Service Execution</strong><br/>
          Worked on analytics-driven workflows and privacy-related processes,
          ensuring services aligned with regional regulations and internal
          compliance standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Household Health Graph Engine (Independent Project)</strong><br/>
          Designed a graph-based schema to model household health data, with an
          emphasis on structure, constraints, and explainability rather than
          model novelty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BioAI Nutrition (Independent Project)</strong><br/>
          Built a prototype personalized nutrition platform using FastAPI and Next.js,
          exploring practical system design for handling sensitive user data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Trained as an embedded and software engineer, with early experience
          in low-level systems and platform development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transitioned into technical project management roles, focusing on
          execution, coordination, and delivery in complex production environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently re-centering my career around software systems and
          platform-oriented leadership through formal graduate study and
          independent technical work.
